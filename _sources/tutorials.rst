Tutorials
===============

Basics
^^^^^^^^^^^
These tutorials include some basic examples on how to use kessler

Advanced
^^^^^^^^^^^
These tutorials are more advanced examples on how to leverage kessler framework 
for more complex tasks. In particular, we will cover both the deep learning module (where
kessler is used to predict CDMs) and the probabilistic programming one (where kessler is used
as a probabilistic generative model for CDMs)
